    "# Creating the Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The creation of the encoder was the core of this third assingment. Obviously, it is very easy to train a simple auto-encoder that performs extremely well on the MNIST set, since the dataset itself is very simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this assigment though, this was not enough; we also needed to ensure that the encoding was useful in itself, and that the decoder didn't just learn to successfully decode whatever weird compression the encoder was coming up with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first intuition was to just make the decoder as simple as possible, let the encoder do the heavy lifting. This proved to not be such a great strategy, probably because the decoder didn't give enough feedback to help the encoder capture any meaningful patterns. Nonetheless, we were still unwilling to allow the decoder to do the heavy lifting, so we decided to create a custom loss function that captured exactly the information we wanted to capture, namely whether or not the distances of the images in the new space retained their ratios.

    "## Custom loss function\n",
    "### General\n",
    "Our initial idea was to create a vector of the indexes of the k-nearest neighbors for every image in every batch, before and after the encoding. Then we would calculate something like the Kendall-Tau coefficient for every pair of vectors and using this derrive a loss value. Using this loss along with the prediction loss, would ensure that not only the encoder captured enough information to properly recreate the original image, but also that the encoding was meaningful in itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't implement this exact algorithm due to a technical limitation (i.e. operations on indices not being automatically differentiable in tensorflow) but we tried to approximate a loss function of this form. The results were satisfactorily enough. "

    "What was left then, was to do hyperparameter searches in order to find the best set of parameters. In order to get the best out of every combination of parameters, we allowed a large number of epochs `(40)` but used an early stopping with a small tolerance `(3)`. We also run each hyperparameter search with a set number of batches.\n",

    "Sadly, there wasn't a clear correlation between the validation loss in training and the performance of algorithm in our nearest neighbor search, so we don't a nice graph to show you. That of course means that our approach didn't exactly capture what we needed it to capture, but it ended up working well enough. \n",

    "In particular, with a `latent dimension = 78` our approached achieved a `MAF = 1.2` and a much better average approximation factor, whilst being `~5` slower than our best LSH. \n",

    "We managed to achieve a `MAF = 1.7` with a `latent dimension = 20`. This time the exhaustive search in the latent space was just `~2.5` times slower than our best LSH. This we achieved with the model shown below. "
